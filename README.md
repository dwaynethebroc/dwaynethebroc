# **Hi, I'm Broc Johnson**

    A former product manager who would find any excuse to work with the developers, and wouldn't be satisfied 
    if I didn't truly understand the problem. 
    Not content with being only semi-involved in the tech world, 
    I took a leap of faith and quit my job to travel and upskill myself.

    Learning to make dynamic websites has taught me 
    the importance of  having strong fundamentals, 
    with an emphasis on simple solutions 
    and an allergy to an over-reliance on frameworks. 
    I'm currently on the lookout for a role in front-end web development, ideally writing/maintaining HTML, CSS, Javascript languages. 
    My ideal role is working for a mid-size company with experienced developers to work alongside and learn from. 
    If you're hiring, let's chat.

    - 💻 Very comfortable utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript
    - 🍎 I am actively learning Ruby/RoR and React in my free-time
    - 💭 Aspire to continue my learning - SQL, Python
    - 🌉 Interested in finding open-source projects to contribute to
    - 📥 How to reach me: LinkedIn, Email (in sidebar)
    - 📣 Open to work remotely or in the San Diego area. Let's connect!
