## Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Broc Johnson

    I am a hard-working problem solver who is kicking himself for not realizing sooner that programming is what brings me joy. A former product manager who would find any excuse to work with the developers to become the go to "technical manager" before I took a leap of faith and quit my job. 

    I have used the last few years to upskill myself, absorb all the HTML5 and Javascript content I could find, and work on small projects. I'm currently on the lookout for a role in front-end web development, ideally writing HTML, CSS, Javascript languages. Would love to work for a mid-size company with experienced developers to work alongside and learn from. If you're hiring let's chat. 

    - 💻 Very comfortable utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript
    - 🍎 I am actively learning Ruby/RoR and React in my free-time
    - 💭 Aspire to continue my learning: especially SQL, Python
    - 🌉 Interested in finding open-source projects to contribute to
    - 📥 How to reach me: LinkedIn, Email (in sidebar)
    - 📣 Open to work remotely or in the San Diego area. Let's connect!
